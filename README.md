A gamification platform that grants a REST API and  a database and also a Swagger UI to facilitate the creation of gamification services and to connect any application in any field of work to our internal software. This was created during the CST Hackathon which lasted for 24 hours, in Brasov, Romania.

We have developed and also integrated, in a small mobile application called Crazy Coffee, various  gamification services such as Coupons, Quests, Battlepasses, Leaderboards, Spinning Wheels, custom mappings to the "main" application for customers and products so we can interact with them.

Our signature move was a customizable little Crazy Monster, from which you can choose any of the ones that are available from the tier purchased. The vision of this was to have a small companion that you can do activities with and also to customize it based on the events you have completed.

Moreover, we've implemented 3 tiers of software from which you can choose one and you will get, based on a token generated at the purchase of a package, only the services that are offered by the tier picked.

Our UI/UX developer created the website https://hackaton.mihneahututui.eu, to have it as a live demo for our pitch during the projects presentation, and he also created various mock-ups for the frontend of the mobile application,

I've mostly created all the routes and endpoints on the backend that lets the administrator of the software to configure all the accessible gamification services.

Our frontend guys, Andrei and Rares, developed various npm packages for all the gamification services which were translated to React Components to be published and they also developed our small Crazy Coffee application.

Sadly, we did not win any prize because we did way too much compared to others.
